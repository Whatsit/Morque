This file contains information about building and installing
the python code of Orque.

1. Install Python
   a) Go to www.python.org/downloads
   b) Download Python 3.5.0
   c) Run the default installation
2. Download the source code of Orque from the github
3. Open a command window in the Orque folder
4. Input 'python orque.py' to run Orque

--- Google Protocol Buffers ---

In order to run the version of Orque in the 'protoBuffer' folder of the repository
which utilizes the Google Protocol Buffer, you will need to install them on your machine,
as well as set up the Python implementation which can be found in the 'python' folder
of the google/protobuf repository. Use the READMEs to guide your installation. Also note
that the Google Protocol Buffers in the Google repository are only compatible with 
Python 2 (version 2.6 or newer).

--- Orque Multiplayer ---

1. Starting the Server
In order to run the multiplayer aspect of Orque, you must run server.py first. The 
host/port settings for the server are contained in the config.py file. By default, the
server runs on port 8080. This may be changed in the config file. To make the server 
listen to connections from all computers on a network, leave the host variable blank.
Changing that variable to a hostname/ip will make the server listen to only that computer.
When the server has started in a terminal, it will print out the ip address and port that
it is running on.

2. Connecting to the Server
To connect to the server, simple run the client.py file, and include 2 command line parameters:
	1. the ip address of the server to connect to
	2. the port that the server is listening on
An example of running the client file would be :
	> python client.py 255.255.0.255 8080
	
The second parameter for the server port is optional if the server has been started on the
default port. If the port parameter is not specified, it will automatically try to connect
to port 8080.

Currently the multiplayer version of Orque supports player movement only. The puzzle rooms and
attacking do not work.
